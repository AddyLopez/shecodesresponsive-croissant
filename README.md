## Description

Student assignment for SheCodes Responsive coding workshop. (Note: "Croissant.org" is a fictional name.)

**_Learning objective_**: To deploy to Netlify a basic, multi-page website about croissants. Beyond coding the HTML, applying responsive styling with CSS, and linking multiple HTML files, this assignment called for practice in integrating the local development environment with the hosting platform Netlify, in reading the deployment logs, and in applying procedures for the prevention or debugging of common errors that may surface during deployment.

## Features

#### HTML

- Multi-page, whimsical design links three HTML files together: a home page, a photo gallery with responsive images, and a contact page capable of opening the user's email client upon a single click

- HTML elements: html, head, meta, link, title, body, h1, h2, p, ul, li, a, img, div, br

- HTML attributes: name, content, href, rel, style, class, title, target, src, alt

- Inline HTML styling of background images

- Imported custom font from Google Fonts

---

#### CSS

- Responsive CSS, including responsive navigation, responsive images, and advanced techniques such as flexbox and media queries

- CSS properties: background, background-color, border, color, display, font-family, font-size, font-weight, justify-content, letter-spacing, list-style, margin, opacity, padding, text-align, text-decoration

- Hover effect on links

- Bootstrap grid and utility classes for responsive styling

---

#### Accessibility, Design, & Workflow Considerations

- Accessibility rating by Lighthouse report: 100/100 for desktops and 100/100 for mobile devices.

- Skilled use of Google Chrome's DevTools for debugging and prototyping changes in the browser. The toggle device tools were especially useful for testing the responsiveness of my code on devices of different sizes.

- Coded in VS Code using professional development workflow tools such as Live Server and GitHub Desktop, with hosting on Netlify, implementing a process of continuous deployment

- The background motif with the picnic pattern and croissant emojis is a detail that I put together myself to have more fun with the assignment and to add more character to the fictional "Croissant.org" than was evident in the demo website (see below). I designed the banner sections to evoke baking because it was a playful way to draw on the yummy, sensuous qualities of a croissant that appeal to me and apply them as thematic material for the design.

- Includes this polished README, written with Markdown
