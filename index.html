      <h2>Legendary Origins of the Croissant:</h2>
      <div class="legend">
        "The legends include tales that [the croissant] was invented in Europe
        to celebrate the defeat of the Umayyad forces by the Franks at the
        Battle of Tours in 732, with the shape representing the Islamic
        crescent; that it was invented in Buda; or, according to other sources,
        in Vienna in 1683 to celebrate the defeat of the Ottomans by Christian
        forces in the siege of the city, as a reference to the crescents on the
        Ottoman flags, when bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling
        operation and gave the alarm.<br /><br />"[...] Alan Davidson proposed
        that the Islamic origin story originated with 20th-century writer Alfred
        Gottschalk, who gave two versions, one in the Larousse Gastronomique and
        the other in his History of Food and Gastronomy: <br /><br />
        <div class="legend-paragraph">
          'According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in
          detail, a baker of the 17th century, working through the night at a
          time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686) was
          under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds
          which, on investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to
          invade the city by tunneling under the walls. The tunnel was blown up.
          The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake
          crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent
          being the symbol of Islam. He was duly rewarded in this way, and the
          croissant was born. The story seems to owe its origin, or at least its
          wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant
          for the first edition [1938] of the Larousse Gastronomique and there
          gave the legend in the Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686 version; but
          on the history of food, opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683'
          version.' — Alan Davidson, Oxford Companion to Food"
